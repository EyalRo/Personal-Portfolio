Ensuring OCI's cloud offerings met the highest security standards was paramount for this project. As the product manager for the security team, I led a group of engineers focused on ensuring OCI adhered to strict regulations established by the US government. This effort was a critical factor in securing the partnership with TikTok.

Oracle Chosen as TikTok’s Secure Cloud Provider
-----------------------------------------------

Oracle to take a 12.5 percent stake in TikTok Global

**REDWOOD SHORES, Calif.—September 19, 2020**

Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) announced today that it was chosen to become TikTok’s secure cloud technology provider. This technical decision by TikTok was heavily influenced by [Zoom’s recent success](https://www.oracle.com/customers/zoom.html) in moving a large portion of its video conferencing capacity to the Oracle Public Cloud.

“TikTok picked Oracle’s new Generation 2 Cloud infrastructure because it’s much faster, more reliable, and more secure than the first generation technology currently offered by all the other major cloud providers,” said Oracle Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison. “In the 2020 Industry CloudPath survey that IDC recently released where it surveyed 935 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) customers on their satisfaction with the top IaaS vendors including Oracle, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM and Google Cloud.... Oracle IaaS received the highest satisfaction score.”

“As a part of this agreement, TikTok will run on the Oracle Cloud and Oracle will become a minority investor in TikTok Global,” said Oracle CEO Safra Catz. “Oracle will quickly deploy, rapidly scale, and operate TikTok systems in the Oracle Cloud. We are a hundred percent confident in our ability to deliver a highly secure environment to TikTok and ensure data privacy to TikTok’s American users, and users throughout the world. This greatly improved security and guaranteed privacy will enable the continued rapid growth of the TikTok user community to benefit all stakeholders.”

Based on decades of experience securing the world’s most sensitive data, the [Oracle Generation 2 Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) was built from the ground up to fully isolate running applications and autonomously respond to security threats. Oracle will combine its secure cloud technology with continuous code reviews, monitoring, and auditing to provide unprecedented assurance that U.S. TikTok user data is private and secure.
