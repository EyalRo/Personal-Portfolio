MemoryBlocks now offers a **bespoke design feature**, allowing customers to personalize the print thoroughly.

The customer has **Full Creative Control:** Design their block from scratch. Upload any photo, choose the perfect block size and shape, and add custom text or layouts to create a masterpiece reflecting your vision.

The design is then tied into a standard Shopify add-to-cart process, allowing utilization of all Shopify features such as multiple items, billing, editing orders, etc'.
